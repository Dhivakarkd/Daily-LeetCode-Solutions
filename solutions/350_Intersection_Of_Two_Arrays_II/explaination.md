Explanation:
HashMap Initialization:

We use a HashMap to store the counts of each element in the first array (nums1).
For each element in nums1, we increment its count in the map.
Counting Occurrences:

We iterate through nums1 and populate the map with the count of each element.
Finding Intersections:

We create a List called result to store the intersection elements.
We iterate through the second array (nums2).
For each element in nums2, we check if it exists in the map and has a non-zero count.
If it does, we add it to the result list and decrement its count in the map.
Converting List to Array:

Finally, we convert the result list to an array intersection.
Output:

We print the elements of the intersection array to display the result.
Follow-up Questions:
If the arrays are already sorted:

If nums1 and nums2 are already sorted, you can use a two-pointer technique to find the intersection in O(n + m) time, where n and m are the lengths of the arrays.
If nums1's size is small compared to nums2's size:

If nums1 is much smaller than nums2, it is more efficient to iterate over nums1 and use a HashMap for nums2. This reduces the space complexity and may improve performance.
If elements of nums2 are stored on disk and memory is limited:

If nums2 cannot be loaded into memory all at once, you can read it in chunks. For each chunk, use the HashMap created from nums1 to find the intersections. This approach requires multiple passes over nums2 but works with limited memory.
This solution ensures that we efficiently find the intersection of two arrays while handling different constraints and scenarios.
