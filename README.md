## About
This repository contains my daily submissions to LeetCode problems. The goal is to consistently solve at least one problem a day, improve my problem-solving skills, and share my solutions with the community. 

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```plaintext
Daily-LeetCode-Solution_1717/
│
├── README.md
├── solutions/
│   ├── problem1/
│   │   ├── Problem1.java (or .py, .js, etc.)
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── problem2/
│   │   ├── Problem2.java
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
└── ...
```
- Each problem has its own directory inside the `solutions/` folder.
- Each problem directory contains:
  - The solution file(s) (e.g., `Problem1.java`, `Problem1.py`).
  - A `README.md` file with a description of the problem, the approach, and any insights or challenges faced.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Daily-LeetCode-Solution_1717.git

    ```

2. **Navigate to a Solution_1190**:
    ```sh
    cd solutions/problem1
    ```

3. **Run the Solution_1190**:
    - For Java:
      ```sh
      javac Problem1.java
      java Problem1
      ```
    - For Python:
      ```sh
      python Problem1.py
      ```
    - For JavaScript:
      ```sh
      node Problem1.js
      ```

4. **Explore the Explanation**:
    - Read the `README.md` in each problem directory to understand the approach and thought process behind the solution.
